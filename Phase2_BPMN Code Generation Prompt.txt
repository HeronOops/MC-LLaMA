Please generate only the <process> section of a BPMN 2.0 process definition in XML format based on the provided BPMN model description. The structure of the generated process must strictly align with the provided description. While details may be adjusted if there are inconsistencies or unreasonable elements, the main structure and flow must remain consistent with the described BPMN elements. Ensure that the process logic is coherent, the elements are properly connected, and BPMN standards are followed. Only return the XML code for the <process> section, without any additional content.

Gateways: Exclusive Gateway, Parallel Gateway, Event-based Gateway

Tasks: Task, User Task, Service Task, Business Rule Task, Script Task

Sub-processes: Call Activity, Transaction, Event Sub-process, Sub-process (Collapsed), Sub-process (Expanded)
