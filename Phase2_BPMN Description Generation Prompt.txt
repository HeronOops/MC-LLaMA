Please provide a high-level description for a BPMN 2.0 <process> snippet, focusing on the provided BPMN structure".
Do not output actual BPMN XML code; instead, give a concise textual overview that explains:
1. The primary events, tasks, gateways, and data objects or sub-processes in the flow (based on the BPMN elements listed below).
2. How these elements connect in a realistic industrial scenario under the umbrella of the specified BPMN structure approach.
3. The rationale for each step within a typical industrial application context.

Ensure the process logic is feasible, follows BPMN 2.0 standards, and would be executable if implemented in XML.

Available BPMN Elements:
- Gateways: Exclusive gateway, Parallel gateway, Event-based gateway
- Tasks: Task, User task, Service task, Business rule task, Script task
- Sub-processes: Call activity, Transaction, Event sub-process, Sub-process (collapsed), Sub-process (expanded)
- Events: (Start, Intermediate, Boundary, End, etc.)
- Data: Data store reference, Data object reference
- Participants: Expanded pool/participant, Empty pool/participant

Output Format:
- Produce only a concise textual description of the <process> logic (no actual XML).
- Emphasize how the specified BPMN structure shapes the flow, connections, and triggers between elements.
- Summarize how each step triggers the next in a straightforward manner.

Example (simplified illustration, not real XML):
{description_example}

BPMN structure:
{bpmn_structure}
